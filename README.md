Gregor's Green Threads (GGT) is a library for implementing green threads on any
C-compatible system. Green threads are threads implemented without
operating-system support. Although GGT is portable, it imposes onerous
requirements on how compatible C code is written, and a performance penalty.

GGT's API is documented in [API.md](API.md).
